            <font size="+3">I</font>N the district called
            Ephrath, belonging to the tribe of Judah, stood the
            city of Bethlehem, or "house of bread." It was a city
            with walls and gates, and lay between fruitful hills
            and well-watered valleys. There among pleasant
            cornfields and pasture lands lived a man named
            Elimelech, which means "my God is my King." He was
            descended from one of the princes of Judah, and was a
            man of means and consequence.

        </p>
        <p>
            Elimelech's wife was named Naomi, meaning "pleasant,"
            and they had two sons whose names were Mahlon and
            Chilion. This old and noble family lived in this
            fertile region, amid pleasant surroundings, and with
            happy prospects, until one of the frequent famines that
            were brought on by want of rain visited their district.

        </p>
        <p>
            Leaving the parched and sterile fields around
            Bethlehem, Elimelech, his family and his flocks, left
            their home and settled in the rich and well-watered
            lands of the Moabites, beyond the Jordan. As a wealthy
            foreigner, he probably was well received by the people
            of Moab, and secured good pasturage for his sheep and
            cattle.

            But much trouble was in store for this family,
            notwithstanding its wealth had enabled them to leave
            their own famine-stricken lands. First Elimelech died,
            and the family was without a head.

            Then Mahlon married a beautiful woman of the country in
            which he was then living, named Ruth, and his brother
            Chilion married another named Orpah. Such marriages
            were against the law of Moses, because the Moabites
            worshipped idols, but as the nation was descended from
            Lot, the nephew of Abraham, the marriages were not so
            bad as they would have been with women belonging to
            other of the different tribes of Canaan.

        <p>
            After a while both of the sons of Naomi died, and she
            was left a childless widow in a strange land. By her
            gracious ways she had won the affection of both Ruth
            and Orpah, and now sorrow locked their hearts together
            in sympathy. At length, Naomi turned her longing eyes
            to her old home in Bethlehem. Ten years had come and
            gone since she left it, and now the news had reached
            her that there was plenty of food there.
        </p>
        <p>
            Naomi and her two daughters-in-law started on their way
            to the land of Judah. After a while, thinking that they
            had accompanied her far enough, Naomi bade Ruth and
            Orpah return to their own mothers' homes, and spoke
            very kindly to them. She kissed them and would have
            taken leave of them, but they insisted that they would
            go with her to the home of her own people.
        </p>
        <p align="center">
            <img src="images/8.jpg" alt=
            "&quot;NAOMI BID RUTH AND ORPAH RETURN.&quot;"><br>
            "NAOMI BID RUTH AND ORPAH RETURN."
        </p>
        <p>
            Then Naomi suggested that they would not be welcome at
            Bethlehem because they were Moabites. They would be
            looked upon with reproach, strangers in a strange land,
            and again she pleaded with them to go home, lest their
            love for her should prove a sorrow to them.

            BETHLEHEM.
        </p>
        <p>
            Orpah was persuaded to return and settle down among her
            kindred, and probably did so from a sense of duty; but
            Ruth would not leave Naomi, although her mother-in-law
            gave her one more opportunity to go back to Moab.
        </p>
        <p>
            The chief cause for separation, according to Naomi,
            was, not that they belonged to different races, but
            that they did not worship the same God. But Ruth, in
            words at once pathetic and sincere, unselfish in spirit
            and expression, declared her resolve.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>"Intreat me not to leave thee, and to return from
            following after thee: for whither thou goest I will go;
            and where thou lodgest I will lodge: thy people shall
            be my people, and thy God my God: where thou diest will
            I die, and there will I be buried: the Lord do so to
            me, and more also, if aught but death part thee and
            me."</i>
        </p>
        <p align="center">
            <img src="images/10.jpg" alt=
            "&quot;'INTREAT ME NOT TO LEAVE THEE.'&quot;"><br>
            "'INTREAT ME NOT TO LEAVE THEE.'"
        </p>
        <p>
            Ruth gave up father and mother, friends and relatives,
            religion and country, and chose poverty and a life
            among strangers because of her love for Naomi, and her
            trust in Naomi's God. They reached Bethlehem about the
            beginning of the barley harvest, and secured some kind
            of a home.
        </p>
        <p>
            The city of Bethlehem was stirred by the return of
            Naomi. She had left them accompanied by husband and
            sons, and in prosperity. She returned, altered in
            circumstances, changed in appearance, and accompanied
            only by a Moabitish woman.
        </p>

        <p>
            Her friends could hardly believe their eyes, and
            exclaimed, "Is this Naomi?" To which she would reply,
            "Call me not Naomi, 'pleasant,' call me Mara, 'bitter,'
            for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me."
            There was much surprise shown at the return of Naomi
            with Ruth, but there is no record that people were
            helpful or even kind to them, and probably the first
            thing they had to do was to secure food.
        </p>

        <p>
            As it was harvest time, Ruth volunteered to go into the
            fields and glean, and so, one morning, she went forth
            as an alien, among strangers, to find bread for the
            two. She came to one of the fields of Boaz, a man of
            wealth and position, and a kinsman of Elimelech, and
            asked permission to glean among the sheaves.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the glory of the early morning, a band of reapers
            were cutting the bearded barley with their sickles.
            Behind them, women bound the grain in sheaves, and
            behind these workers were a group of gleaners, made up
            from the aged and the young.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ruth took her place among the gleaners, and bending her
            back like the rest gathered the stray ears left by the
            binders. The overseer watched both laborers and
            gleaners. All were known to him, even the beautiful
            stranger from the land of Moab.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
            As the day advanced, Boaz entered the field with the
            salutation to his men, "The Lord be with you." They
            replied, "The Lord bless thee." Then glancing around
            the field, Boaz saw Ruth among the gleaners and asked
            the overseer who she was. The overseer replied that she
            was the Moabitish woman who came back with Naomi, and
            that she had asked permission to gather the barley ears
            with the rest of the gleaners.
        </p>
        <p>
            Boaz was interested at once, and, struck by Ruth's
            modesty and beauty, he went to her and said she was not
            to glean in any other fields but his all the time of
            harvest. He told her she need fear no rudeness from the
            young men, for he had laid his commands upon them not
            to molest or offend her. He also told her that when she
            was thirsty she was to drink of what had been prepared
            for the reapers.

        </p>
        <p>
            Ruth was deeply touched by this slight kindness. Bowing
            to the ground she asked why it was that she, a
            stranger, had found grace in his sight. Boaz replied
            that he had learned of her loving treatment of Naomi,
            since the death of her husband, and how she had left
            her father and her mother, and the land where she was
            born, to live with her mother-in-law; and then he
            invoked the blessing of God upon her and upon her work.
        </p>
        <p align="center">
            <img src="images/15.jpg" alt=
            "&quot;BOAZ INVOKED THE BLESSING OF GOD UPON HER.&quot;"><br>

            "BOAZ INVOKED THE BLESSING OF GOD UPON HER."
        </p>
        <p>
            The sympathy and sincerity of Boaz were very grateful
            to Ruth. She was comforted as well, for she knew that
            he had recognized her goodness to Naomi, and knew that
            she had come to trust in the care of God.
        </p>
        <p>
            At meal time Boaz invited her to eat with the reapers,
            and even handed food to her himself. After the simple
            meal was eaten and Ruth was again among the gleaners,
            Boaz told the reapers to let her glean wherever she
            chose, and to drop some of the grain on purpose for
            her, so that her work might be lightened.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the sun began to set, all went their homeward way,
            and when Ruth reached her home she beat out all the
            ears of barley she had gleaned and found there were
            three pecks of barley, about ten times as much as a
            single Israelite's daily portion of manna while
            wandering in the wilderness. Her first day's work had
            secured provision for several days to come.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Naomi saw what a quantity of barley Ruth had
            brought home, she asked in whose field she had gleaned.
            Then Ruth related all the events of the day, and how
            Boaz had been kind to her.
        </p>
        <p>
            It pleased Naomi to hear that Boaz had shown kindness
            to Ruth and to her, because he was a relation of her
            husband, and one whose duty it was to care for a widow,
            and one who had a right to help them by law. Such a
            relative was called a goel, meaning a "redeemer."
        </p>
        <p>
            So the days of the harvest passed. Every day Ruth
            gleaned in the fields, and at night returned to Naomi.
            Each day she kept close by the maidens of Boaz, through
            the barley harvest, and then to the last ingathering of
            the wheat.
        </p>
        <p align="center">
            <img src="images/16.jpg" alt=
            "&quot;EVERY DAY RUTH GLEANED IN THE FIELDS.&quot;"><br>

            "EVERY DAY RUTH GLEANED IN THE FIELDS."
        </p>
        <p>
            The harvest finished, the threshing of the grain began.
            Naomi was anxious that the "redeemer" should exercise
            his right. According to Israelitish law, when a man
            died and left his wife childless, his nearest of kin
            was to take the widow to be his wife, and any son born
            of this marriage should inherit the name and
            possessions of the first husband.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this way he kept his brother's name and inheritance
            from being blotted out. Naomi saw with thankfulness
            that Divine Love had led Ruth to the protection of her
            rightful guardian.
        </p>
        <p>
            So Naomi planned how Ruth should have an opportunity of
            speaking to Boaz. She told her to take off the sign of
            her mourning and widowhood, and go to the
            threshing-floor when the grain was beaten out.
        </p>
        <p>
            These threshing-floors were either natural spaces of
            rock, or open places covered with large flat stones, so
            that the grain could be readily separated from the husk
            without waste, and the chaff easily blown away.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sheaves of grain were spread on these places, and a
            wooden sledge, covered with iron teeth, was dragged
            over them by oxen until all the grain had fallen from
            the dry ears. It was a joyful time, the oxen were not
            muzzled, so they could eat while they worked, and the
            master and his servants feasted.
        </p>
        <p align="center">
            <img src="images/17.jpg" alt=
            "&quot;THE OXEN WERE NOT MUZZLED.&quot;"><br>
            "THE OXEN WERE NOT MUZZLED."
        </p>
        <p>
            When the grain was threshed, it was cleaned by the cool
            winds of morning or evening, and by the aid of large
            fans. As this winnowing had to be done when the breezes
            sprang up, master and servant often slept all night at
            the threshing floors, so as to be ready for the first
            breath of wind, and to see that the grain was not
            stolen.
        </p>
        <p>
            Naomi told Ruth to go to the threshing-floor of Boaz,
            and speak to him during the night. Ruth did as she was
            told, and at the proper time told Boaz that he had the
            right to redeem her. Boaz was pleased, and told her
            that he would do as she had said.
        </p>
        <p>
            But he reminded her that while he was her kinsman,
            there was another who was nearer. He would see this man
            in the morning, and if he would not exercise his right
            as "redeemer," he would perform the part of a kinsman
            himself. He told her to lie quietly down until morning,
            and when it was nearly sunrise he poured into the veil
            or cloak that she wore, six measures of barley, and
            sent her home to Naomi.
        </p>
        <p align="center">
            <img src="images/18.jpg" alt=
            "&quot;GAVE HER SIX MEASURES OF BARLEY.&quot;"><br>
            "GAVE HER SIX MEASURES OF BARLEY."
        </p>
        <p>
            Ruth went on her way in the dusk of dawn, bearing the
            present of grain on her head, as was the custom of the
            country. She was returning to her mother-in-law with a
            story of hope and blessing that had come to her in the
            promise of Boaz.
        </p>
        <p>
            When she reached home, Naomi's first question was, "How
            hast thou fared, my daughter?" Then Ruth told her all
            that Boaz had said and done, and how he had given her
            the barley, saying as he did so, "Go not empty to thy
            mother-in-law." Naomi was pleased, for she understood
            how Boaz and Ruth felt towards each other, and so said:
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>"Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the
            matter will fare; for the man will not rest until he
            have finished the thing this day."</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            In Palestine, nearly every town, and many villages,
            were surrounded by walls, and at the main entrances
            there were deep gateways which generally had broad and
            shady spaces in front, where people frequently met.
        </p>
        <p>
            These gates became the chief places of interest. They
            were often arched over and used as watch towers; they
            became the guard-house, business was transacted there,
            and in this way they became markets.
        </p>
        <p>
            People met in the city gates to discuss the news of the
            day, and proclamations were made there. Kings and
            rulers gave audience there, and being a place of
            general resort, the elders sat there to dispense
            justice.
        </p>
        <p align="center">
            <img src="images/19.jpg" alt=
            "&quot;KINGS AND RULERS GAVE AUDIENCE THERE.&quot;"><br>

            "KINGS AND RULERS GAVE AUDIENCE THERE."
        </p>
        <p>
            In the morning, then, Boaz went to the gateway of the
            city of Bethlehem, ready to fulfill his pledge to Ruth.
            As he sat there, the man who was the nearest relative
            of Elimelech passed by. Boaz summoned him to a seat by
            himself, using the legal form of expression by which he
            would understand that there was special business to be
            transacted.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then the elders, or wise and respected citizens were
            asked to hear Boaz's case, and to be at once judges and
            responsible witnesses, and to ratify the proceedings.
            In their presence, and in the hearing of the people who
            gathered near, Boaz stated the facts, saying to the
            "redeemer":
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>"Naomi, that is come again out of the country of
            Moab, seeketh the parcel of land which was our brother
            Elimelech's: and I thought to advertise thee, saying,
            Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of
            my people."</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            And then Boaz went on and asked the man if he would
            redeem it, and the man said that he would do so. He
            further explained to him the customs and conditions of
            the law, and told him if he took the land he must also
            take Ruth the Moabitess to be his wife.
        </p>
        <p>
            But this was a part of the bargain that the man did not
            want to perform, so he turned his right of redemption
            over to Boaz, giving as his reason, that he would not
            mind buying the field if it would become his own
            personal property, but if he should marry Ruth the
            field he bought would not belong to him; and so he
            would have paid out money for something which would
            bring him little or no benefit.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is not at all unlikely that he refused to marry Ruth
            because she was a Moabitess, fearing that a marriage
            with an alien might mar his reputation and position in
            the city.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the man had announced his decision, it was
            confirmed by the usual custom in all cases of redeeming
            and exchanging. The one giving up the claim took off
            his sandal and gave it to the one who received the
            claim. The matter was thus ratified, as though a bond
            had been drawn up and signed.
        </p>
        <p align="center">
            <img src="images/20.jpg" alt=
            "&quot;HE DREW OFF HIS SANDAL AND HANDED IT TO BOAZ.&quot;"><br>

            "HE DREW OFF HIS SANDAL AND HANDED IT TO BOAZ."
        </p>
        <p>
            In this way the unnamed kinsman of Elimelech refused to
            redeem Ruth and her land, and as a proof of it he drew
            off his sandal and handed it to Boaz before the ten
            elders and all the people, thus transferring to him the
            legal right to be the "redeemer."
        </p>
        <p>
            Boaz then called all present to witness that he had
            that day bought all that was Elimelech's and all that
            was Chilion's and all that was Mahlon's, and also that
            Ruth the Moabitess was to be his wife. And all the
            elders and all the people who were in the gate said
            they would be witnesses.
        </p>
        <p align="center">

            <i>From a Photograph.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            And because Boaz had acted so honorably, all present
            united in asking the blessing of God upon his marriage.
            So, with the approval and best wishes of his neighbors
            and friends, and above all with the blessing of God,
            Boaz and Ruth were married.
        </p>
        <p>
            The story of Ruth is a beautiful one, for it shows how
            the sacrifice and service of love was rewarded. Naomi
            in her old age and declining days was made glad, and
            the alien found a happy home. In time a son was born to
            Boaz and Ruth, and the name of "Obed," or "the serving
            one," was given to it. This boy grew up to be the
            father of Jesse, whose son was the mightiest of
            Israel's kings.
        </p>

            "NAOMI BECAME THE CHILD'S NURSE."
        </p>
        <p>
            When Ruth's baby boy was born, the matrons of Bethlehem
            congratulated Naomi, who became the child's nurse. The
            boy grew up to be the joy of his parents and the
            comfort of his adopted grandmother, and in time the
            ancestor of Mary the mother of Jesus.

            The memory of the faithful, loving Ruth has been a
            sweet and living picture for many centuries. She left
            her home, her friends, her all, to be kind and good to
            her broken-hearted mother-in-law, and to serve God, and
            found much more than she gave up. She brought
            consolation to Naomi, there came to her love,
            prosperity, and peace, and through her children's
            children, Jesus the Christ.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
